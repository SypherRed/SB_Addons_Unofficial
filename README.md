# SB_Addons_Unofficial

I will create some addons eventually for the SB-Bot and its Addon function.
Very first release to figure stuff out with this bot was the translation command.

### Translation Command How to:

* Set your desired config parameters in "/Addons/Configs/translate.yml"
* Create the channel for logging translations to (e.g. translations)
* Do "npm i @vitalets/google-translate-api"

### UserInfo Command How to:

* Set your desired config parameters in "/Addons/Configs/userinfo.yml"
* Do "npm i moment"

### Minecraft UserInfo Command How to:

* Set your desired config parameters in "/Addons/Configs/MCUser.yml"
* Do "npm i axios"

### Chat Transcript Command How to:

* Set your desired config parameters in "/Addons/Configs/chat-transcript.yml"
* Do "npm i discord-html-transcripts"
